# ROS2_Workshop

## Introduction to ROS2 Workshop

Welcome to the ROS2 Workshop! This workshop is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2), a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. Throughout this workshop, you will learn how to create and manage nodes, work with topics and services, and develop your own robotic applications using ROS2.

## Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It helps track changes, revert to previous stages, and collaborate efficiently with others. In this section, you will learn the basics of Git, including how to set up a repository, commit changes, and push to a remote repository.

### Setting Up Git

To start using Git, you need to configure your user information, which will be used in your commits.

```sh
git config --global user.name "your name"
git config --global user.email "your email"
```

### Initializing a Repository

To create a new Git repository, navigate to your project directory and run:

```sh
git init
```

### Making Changes and Committing

After making changes to your files, you can add them to the staging area and commit them to the repository:

```sh
git add <file>
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### Pushing to a Remote Repository

To push your changes to a remote repository, you need to add the remote URL and push the changes:

```sh
git remote add origin <remote_url>
git push -u origin master
```

With these basics, you are ready to start using Git for version control in your projects.
